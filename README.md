# CPRG352 Lab 5
*Bryan Meyer*

## Goal

The goal of this lab is to demonstrate a knowledge of JSTL and session management by creating a Shopping List app with a simple login page and a dynamic shopping list that the user can modify. The full lab assignment document can be found in the root folder, Lab5.docx.

## Technologies

For this lab, I used Netbeans 12.6, JDK 17, and Tomcat 9.

## Structure and Architecture

This lab uses a simple MVC architecture.
There is one servlet, ShoppingListServlet. This servlet provides the majority of the functionality of the app, and also serves the login page and the shopping list page.

## How Do I Run It?

If you have the same versions of Netbeans, Java, and Tomcat as above, simply import the project into Netbeans and run it from there.
If your Netbeans doesn't open the browser automatically, open it and go to http://localhost:8080/lab5
